# Tree

# Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.
#
# The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
#
# For example, given a 3-ary tree:
#
#
#
#
#
#
# We should return its max depth, which is 3.
#
#
#
# Note:
#
# The depth of the tree is at most 1000.
# The total number of nodes is at most 5000.
