# Tree; Depth First Search

# Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.
#
#
#
# For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).
#
# Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.
#
# Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

# Definition for a binary tree node.

#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None
